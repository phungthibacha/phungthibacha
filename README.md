Hi there! I'm Phung Thi Bac Ha, a passionate and certified Databricks Data Engineer Professional with a strong focus on building robust and scalable data solutions. I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable insights, leveraging cloud technologies and modern data engineering practices.

I'm proficient in various cloud platforms, data warehousing solutions, and data transformation tools, including:

*   **Cloud Platforms:** Azure, AWS
*   **Data Warehouses:** Snowflake
*   **ETL/ELT:** dbt, Databricks
*   **Programming Languages:** SQL, Python, PySpark

## Projects

Here's a glimpse into some of the projects I've been working on:

### Data Engineering Projects

**Azure + Databricks:**

*   [Accelerated Healthcare Revenue Management Insights using Azure and Databricks](https://github.com/phungthibacha/Accelerated-Healthcare-Revenue-Management-Insights-using-Azure-and-Databricks): This project develops a robust, cloud-based data engineering pipeline to provide actionable insights for healthcare revenue cycle management (RCM). Leveraging Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Delta Lake, the pipeline ingests, transforms, and quality-checks data from diverse sources (EMR, claims, APIs) within a Medallion architecture. By implementing SCD2 and generating key fact and dimension tables, the project empowers healthcare providers with data-driven decision-making to optimize revenue cycle efficiency, reduce costs, and improve financial performance. Secure credential management is ensured through Azure Key Vault.
*   [Unlocking Customer Insights: On-Premises to Azure Data Pipeline with Databricks](https://github.com/phungthibacha/Unlocking-Customer-Insights-On-Premises-to-Azure-Data-Pipeline-with-Databricks): This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline solution using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and Azure Key Vault. It extracts data from an on-premises MySQL database, performs transformations (including SCD Type 2 implementation), and creates an optimized "One Big Table" for analytical reporting. The pipeline is automated for daily execution.
*   [End-to-End Data Engineering with Azure, Databricks and dbt: A Deep Dive](https://github.com/phungthibacha/adventureworks_dbt_databricks): This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline leveraging Azure Databricks, Data Build Tool (DBT), and Azure cloud services. The project adheres to a Medalion Architecture, a data management paradigm that promotes a structured and iterative approach to data processing, ensuring data quality and reliability throughout the lifecycle.

**AWS + Snowflake + dbt:**

*   [Project 1 Name](Project 1 Link): Brief description of Project 1 (e.g., Implementing an ELT pipeline on AWS using Snowflake for data warehousing and dbt for transformations.)
*   [Project 2 Name](Project 2 Link): Brief description of Project 2 (e.g., Building a data mart on Snowflake using dbt for business intelligence reporting.)

### Data Analyst Projects

**On-Premise (SQL):**

*   [Atliq Hardware Data Analytics Project using MySQL](https://github.com/phungthibacha/MySQL_Sale-SupplyChain_Analysis): Data warehouse built using MySQL with a star & snowflake schema architecture for efficient analysis. Developing insightful reports, and automating tasks (User-defined functions & Store procedures for generating various reports) to empower business users with self-service capabilities.

**Python:**

*   [Retail Strategy Optimization: A Data-Driven Journey for Chip Retail Management](https://github.com/phungthibacha/Python_Retail-Strategy-and-Analytics): Using Python to understand chip purchasing behavior, identify key customer segments, and provide actionable recommendations for boosting chip sales while keeping snackers happy.
*   [Data Analysis in Hospitality Domain: Atliq Grands Case Study](https://github.com/phungthibacha/Python_Data_Analysis_Hospitality_Domain): Atliq Grands, a prominent Indian hotel chain, faced declining revenue and market share. This project leverages data analytics to improve their decision-making and regain a competitive edge.

**Power BI:**

*   [Business Insights 360 Dashboard for Atliq Hardware: Unleashing Data-Driven Insights to Empower Decision-Making](https://github.com/phungthibacha/PowerBI_Business_Insights360_For_Department_Managers): A comprehensive Business Intelligence 360 dashboard developed in Power BI for Atliq Hardware, a leading Indian computer peripherals manufacturer. The dashboard empowers various departments with actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making, boost operational efficiency, and strengthen the company's competitive edge.
*   [Power BI Dashboard for Call Center Performance Analysis](https://github.com/phungthibacha/PowerBI_Call_Centre_Performance): Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for a call center operation. Built during my virtual data analyst internship at PwC, this project helped PhoneNow's call center manager gain valuable insights into customer and agent behavior, driving actionable improvements.

## Skills

*   Databricks (Certified Data Engineer Professional)
*   Azure Data Services (e.g., Data Factory, Data Lake Storage, Event Hubs)
*   AWS Services (e.g., S3, EC2, Lambda)
*   Snowflake
*   dbt (Data Build Tool)
*   SQL (MySQL, etc.)
*   Python
*   PySpark
*   Power BI

I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies in the data engineering field. Feel free to connect and discuss potential collaborations or opportunities!
